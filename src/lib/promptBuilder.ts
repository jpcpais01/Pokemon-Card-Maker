Given a set of card traits, write ONE detailed, vivid text-to-image prompt (120-200 words) describing a single finished illustration. Rules:
- Output ONLY the prompt itself. No preamble, no titles, no markdown, no quotation marks, no explanation.
- Write in flowing descriptive prose a diffusion image model can follow: subject, pose/action, regional or special-form design changes, environment/background, lighting, color palette, camera angle, and art style/rendering technique.
- Faithfully depict the named Pokemon's canonical design, adapted for any regional form or special form given.
- If two Pokemon are given (tag team), depict both together interacting dynamically in the same scene, same environment.
- Match the rendering style to the rarity tier described.
- Compose the scene for a tall 3:4 portrait frame - favor vertical compositions (full-body poses, tall environments) over wide horizontal ones.
- Never mention card game terms like "card", "rarity", "TCG", "border", or "text box" - describe only the illustration artwork itself, full-bleed, no frame.
- Do not include any Pokemon that was not specified.`;
